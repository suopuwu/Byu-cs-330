1. I'd say 257 was pretty simple, but 401 took a while and a lot of code. I took a look at the leetcode comments after I finished, and I agree that it'd be simpler to do 401 by using a hashmap.
2. Again, 257 was easy, but 401 was pretty difficult. I had to really twist my brain around all the paths and data types to really get it. Humans don't really think in parallel, so I'd say that was the main difficulty. Though now that I'm thinking about it, I'm wondering if my solutions even use backtracking. It seems that the purpose for backtracking is that you don't need to think in parallel, so maybe I've messed up there. Though the assignment doesn't say that we should solve them with a specific backtracking solution.
3. I would say that it did. Both involved returning appended arrays recursively. As for abstraction, hmm. You could probably do a bit with the array appending, but I'm struggling to think of any other low hanging fruit. I'd say these are backtracking problems because they can be solved by a backtracking algorithm.
